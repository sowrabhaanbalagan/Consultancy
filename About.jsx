             <h2>A Brief History of Revolutionising <br />The Textile Industry</h2><br />
             <p>Are you tired of spending countless hours and resources on phone calls and one-to-one meetings just to arrive at basics like fair price, delivery terms and payment terms?
<br />
The old-fashioned methods of procurement, marketing, distribution, and sales in the industry often result in a lack of transparency and fairness. In short, the supply chain is broken resulting in huge losses for both sellers and buyers. But no more.

Itâ€™s time to change. I, along with a team of like-minded individuals, founded Santhosh Yarns. Our vision and mission are clear and we are on to it. <br />
